Amareleo is an open-source toolset for Leo developers.

At this stage, Amareleo delivers [amareleo-chain](https://github.com/kaxxa123/amareleo-chain), a lightweight development node that allows for deploying and testing Aleo programs on a local node. Amareleo-Chain is designed as a much lighter drop-in replacement for snarkOS/devnet.sh. 

Key benefits:
1.	__Ease of Use__ – Starting a development testnet is as simple as running `amareleo-chain start`. No extra scripts, no multiple processes, all default parameters set for quick aleo program testing.
 
1.	__Lite__ – Just one process, with minimal memory and CPU usage.

1.	__Fast Startup/Shutdown__ – Drastically reduced node startup and shutdown times. 

1.	__Fresh Chain State__ – Start testing programs with a fresh chain state (default) or retain the chain state across tests.

1.	__Compatibility__ – Compatible with other Aleo tools including `snarkOS` and `leo`.
