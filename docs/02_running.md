To start amareleo-chain, run one of these commands depending on the required chain state:

```BASH
# Start testnet from genesis
amareleo-chain start
```

```BASH
# Start testnet continuing the state from the last run
amareleo-chain start --keep-state
```
For a complete list of commands and arguments, run:

```BASH
# Get list of commands
amareleo-chain help

# Get list of command arguments
amareleo-chain <command> --help
```


## Keep-State

Amareleo-Chain `start` runs in two modes depending on whether `--keep-state` is specified. 

* When `--keep-state` is specified, the chain state is retained across runs.
* When `--keep-state` is not specified, the chain starts from genesis and is discarded on exit.

To avoid conflicts between these two modes, each mode uses a different storage location. This ensures that the two modes remain independent of each other.

The following example demonstrates how mixing runs that includes and excludes `--keep-state` does not cause any state conflicts.

1. Start amareleo-chain for the first time __with__ `--keep-state`

    ```BASH
    amareleo-chain start --keep-state
    ```

    Assume that the chain runs from block 0 to block 100, at which point amareleo-chain is terminated with `CTRL-C`.

1. Start amareleo-chain __without__ `--keep-state`

    ```BASH
    amareleo-chain start
    ```
    
    The chain will again start from block 0. However this won't touch the storage of the previous run. After some time terminate this amareleo-chain instance.

1. Again run amareleo-chain with `--keep-state`

    ```BASH
    amareleo-chain start --keep-state
    ```

    The chain continues from block 100, the last block generated when running in  `--keep-state` mode.


This demonstrates how specifiying `--keep-state` retains the chain state across runs. Each run keeps adding blocks until the chain is deleted using the `clean` command:

```BASH
amareleo-chain clean
```

At the same time, whenever `--keep-state` is not specified, a fresh chain is created.


## Test accounts

Just like running snarkOS with the `--dev <N>` argument, amareleo-chain intializes four accounts loaded with aleo credits that can be used for testing purposes.

The private key for these accounts is well-known and common to both snarkOS and amareleo-chain:
